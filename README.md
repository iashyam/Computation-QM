1. __1-D Eigenvalues__ To determine the energy eigonvalues and eigonstates of a one dimessional potenail and plot them using Hamiltonian Matrix Method. These wavefuncion are very important and sometiems they are difficult to find out analytically but using numpy's strong inbulit methods we can find them easily.

3. __Time Evolution__: The Problem was to find out how will the wavefunction change with time, one dimessional square well potential is given and you have to show the time evolution and calculate the transmission and reflaction probabilities. 
4. __Harmonic Oscillator__: To show that in Coherent State, the expectation value of position and energy oscillates with the classial frequency.

5. __Numerov's Method__: To find out energy eigonvalues and eigonstates using Numerov's Method.
